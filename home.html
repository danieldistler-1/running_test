    <h1>A 12-Week Plan to Walk/Exercise Your Way to Good Health</h1>
    <p>By Mindy Kaling</p>
    <p>Hey there, you gorgeous bunch of people! Are you ready to kick some butt and feel fabulous? Because I sure am! This 12-week plan will have you feeling like Beyonce in no time. We're talking walking, cardio, and interval training - oh my! And let's not forget about the rest days, because girl, you deserve it. So grab those sneakers and let's hustle, because if there's one thing I learned from my time at Dunder Mifflin, it's that a little hard work goes a long way. Speaking of hard work, let me tell you a little story from my childhood. When I was a kid, my mom used to make me do ballet lessons. Now, I'm not the most graceful person, so this was a bit of a challenge for me. But you know what? I stuck with it, and I learned that even when things are tough, you just gotta keep on truckin'. And that's what this plan is all about, my friends. It's about pushing yourself, even when it's hard, because the results are worth it. So let's get moving and show this world what we're made of!</p>
    <p>Week 1-2: Walk for 30 minutes, 2-3 days a week (other days rest)</p>
